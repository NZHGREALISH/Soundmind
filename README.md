# Soundmind - Absolute Pitch Test Game

[English (Current)](README.md) | [ä¸­æ–‡](README_CN.md)

Soundmind is an absolute pitch testing game developed on DE1-SoC FPGA. Players are challenged to identify musical notes by ear, progressing through different difficulty levels to test and improve their absolute pitch ability.

## Features

- ðŸŽµ Support for 5 musical notes (C, D, E, F, G) playback and recognition
- ðŸŽ® Graphical user interface display
- ðŸŽ¯ 4 difficulty levels
- ðŸ“š Practice mode for individual note training
- ðŸŽ¨ Beautiful game interface and animation effects

## Hardware Requirements

- DE1-SoC FPGA development board
- PS/2 keyboard
- VGA monitor
- Audio output device

## Game States

The game includes the following states:

1. **Start Screen** (`GAME_START`)
   - Displays game title and start options
   - Press spacebar to enter practice mode

2. **Practice Mode** (`GAME_STUDY`)
   - Practice each note individually
   - Press C, D, E, F, G keys to listen to corresponding notes
   - Press Enter to access the settings screen

3. **Settings Screen** (`GAME_SETUP`)
   - Select game difficulty (0-3)
   - Use up/down arrow keys to adjust difficulty
   - Press spacebar to start the game

4. **Gameplay** (`GAME_PLAYING`)
   - System randomly plays notes
   - Player must identify the notes correctly
   - Use C, D, E, F, G keys to input notes

5. **Success Screen** (`GAME_SUCCESS`)
   - Shows success message and score
   - Press spacebar to return to start screen

6. **Game Over Screen** (`GAME_OVER`)
   - Shows failure message
   - Press spacebar to return to start screen

## Difficulty Levels

- **Level 0**: Beginner level
  - Longest pause time between notes
  - Suitable for beginners

- **Level 1**: Elementary level
  - Moderate pause time between notes
  - Suitable for players familiar with game mechanics

- **Level 2**: Intermediate level
  - Short pause time between notes
  - Requires faster note identification

- **Level 3**: Advanced level
  - Minimal pause time between notes
  - Requires rapid absolute pitch recognition
